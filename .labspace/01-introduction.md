# Introduction

👋 Welcome to the Docker DevDuck Multi-Agent Workshop! 
During this workshop, you'll learn how to build and deploy a multi-agent system using Docker, Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), and Cerebras AI.


## What are Multi-Agent Systems?

Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are networks of autonomous agents that work together to solve complex problems that would be difficult or impossible for a single agent to handle alone. Each agent is specialized for specific tasks and can communicate with other agents to coordinate their efforts.


### Key Characteristics

- **Autonomy**: Each agent operates independently
- **Social Ability**: Agents communicate and collaborate
- **Reactivity**: Agents respond to environmental changes
- **Pro-activeness**: Agents take initiative to achieve goals

## Why Docker for Multi-Agent Systems?

Docker provides the perfect platform for multi-agent systems because it offers:

### 🚢 **Containerization Benefits**
- **Isolation**: Each agent runs in its own secure environment
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale individual agents based on demand
- **Consistency**: Same behavior across development, testing, and production
- **Resource Management**: Efficient resource allocation per agent

### 🎼 **Orchestration with Docker Compose**
- **Service Discovery**: Agents can easily find and communicate with each other
- **Network Management**: Secure inter-agent communication
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific settings
- **Dependency Management**: Proper startup order and health checks

## The DevDuck System Architecture

In this workshop, you'll build a system called "DevDuck" - a developer assistance platform that uses multiple specialized agents:

    B --> D[Cerebras Agent]
    C --> E[Local Models]
    D --> F[Cerebras Cloud API]
    B --> G[MCP Gateway]
```

### Agent Roles

1. **DevDuck Orchestrator**: The main coordinator that routes requests to appropriate agents
2. **Local Agent**: Handles quick processing tasks using local models
3. **Cerebras Agent**: Leverages powerful cloud-based AI for complex analysis
4. **MCP Gateway**: Manages Model Context Protocol for enhanced capabilities

## Real-World Applications

This workshop demonstrates practical use cases for multi-agent systems:

### 💻 **Software Development Assistance**
- Code generation and explanation
- Bug detection and troubleshooting
- Architecture recommendations
- Testing strategy development

### 🎯 **Intelligent Task Routing**
- Determine which agent is best suited for each request
- Load balancing across multiple agents
- Fallback mechanisms for agent failures

### 📈 **Scalable AI Solutions**
- Combine local and cloud AI capabilities
- Cost-effective resource utilization
- Performance optimization strategies

## Workshop Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

- ✅ **Design multi-agent architectures** using Docker containers
- ✅ **Implement agent communication patterns** using HTTP APIs and message queues
- ✅ **Integrate multiple AI models** (local and cloud-based) in a cohesive system
- ✅ **Deploy and manage** multi-agent systems in production-like environments
- ✅ **Debug and troubleshoot** common multi-agent system issues
- ✅ **Apply best practices** for containerized AI applications

## What Makes This Workshop Special?

### 🎯 **Practical Focus**
Every concept is demonstrated with working code and real deployments.

### 🧪 **Hands-On Labs** 
Interactive exercises that build upon each other progressively.

### 🔄 **Real-World Scenarios**
Based on actual developer workflow automation needs.

### 🏗️ **Production-Ready Patterns**
Learn deployment strategies that work in real environments.

## Workshop Duration

- **Total Time**: 2-3 hours
- **Skill Level**: Intermediate (basic Docker and Python knowledge required)
- **Format**: Self-paced with guided exercises

## Technology Stack

This workshop uses cutting-edge technologies:

- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Container orchestration
- **Python & FastAPI**: Agent implementation and web interfaces
- **Cerebras AI**: High-performance cloud AI models
- **Google ADK**: Agent development framework
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Enhanced agent capabilities

## Getting Ready

Before proceeding to the next section, ensure you have:

- [ ] Docker Desktop installed and running
- [ ] Basic familiarity with command-line interfaces
- [ ] Text editor or IDE for viewing code
- [ ] Internet connection for downloading models and accessing APIs

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    Keep Docker Desktop running throughout the workshop as you'll be frequently starting and stopping containers.

## Next Steps
